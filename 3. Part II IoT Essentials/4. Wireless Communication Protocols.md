#### 3. Wireless Communication Protocols

Wireless communication is a cornerstone of IoT systems, enabling devices to connect and interact without physical connections. In this section, we will explore two widely used wireless communication protocols: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

**Understanding Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE:**

##### Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi is a widely used wireless networking technology that allows IoT devices to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices within a local area network (LAN). It operates on the IEEE 802.11 standards.

**1. Wi-Fi Protocols:**
- **802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax:** Different versions of the Wi-Fi standard, each offering various speeds, ranges, and capabilities.
- **Frequency Bands:** Wi-Fi operates primarily in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The 2.4 GHz band offers broader coverage but is more susceptible to interference, while the 5 GHz band offers faster speeds but with a shorter range.

**2. Configuration:**
- **SSID (Service Set Identifier):** The network name that devices use to identify and connect to a Wi-Fi network.
- **Security Protocols:** WPA2, WPA3, and other encryption methods to secure the network.
- **IP Addressing:** DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is commonly used to assign IP addresses to devices on a Wi-Fi network.

**3. Connecting IoT Devices to Wi-Fi:**
- **Network Credentials:** Devices need the SSID and password to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
- **Wi-Fi Libraries:** Use libraries like `WiFi.h` in Arduino IDE or `esp_wifi.h` in ESP-IDF to manage Wi-Fi connections on microcontrollers like ESP32.

**Example Code: Connecting an ESP32 to Wi-Fi (Arduino IDE):**
```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>

// Replace with your network credentials
const char* ssid = "your_SSID";
const char* password = "your_PASSWORD";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Connect to Wi-Fi network
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

  // Wait for connection
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(1000);
    Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi...");
  }

  Serial.println("Connected to WiFi");
}

void loop() {
  // Add your main code here
}
```

##### Bluetooth LE (Low Energy)

Bluetooth LE is a wireless communication protocol designed for short-range communication with low power consumption, making it ideal for IoT devices that require long battery life.

**1. Bluetooth LE Features:**
- **Low Power Consumption:** Optimized for low energy use, suitable for battery-powered devices.
- **Short Range:** Typically up to 50 meters.
- **Data Rate:** Lower data rates compared to classic Bluetooth, sufficient for sensor data and control commands.

**2. BLE Architecture:**
- **Central and Peripheral Roles:** Central devices (e.g., smartphones) initiate connections and manage data exchange, while peripheral devices (e.g., sensors) advertise their presence and respond to central device requests.
- **GATT (Generic Attribute Profile):** Defines the way data is structured and exchanged over a BLE connection, using services and characteristics.

**3. Implementing BLE Communication:**
- **Advertising:** Peripherals broadcast packets to indicate they are available for connection.
- **Connection:** Central devices connect to peripherals to exchange data.
- **Services and Characteristics:** Services are collections of characteristics, which are the actual data points (e.g., temperature readings, heart rate).

**Example Code: Implementing BLE on ESP32 (Arduino IDE):**
```cpp
#include <BLEDevice.h>
#include <BLEServer.h>
#include <BLEUtils.h>
#include <BLE2902.h>

BLEServer* pServer = NULL;
BLECharacteristic* pCharacteristic = NULL;
bool deviceConnected = false;

// Replace with your own UUIDs
#define SERVICE_UUID        "4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331914b"
#define CHARACTERISTIC_UUID "beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a8"

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Initialize BLE
  BLEDevice::init("ESP32_BLE");

  // Create BLE Server
  pServer = BLEDevice::createServer();
  pServer->setCallbacks(new MyServerCallbacks());

  // Create BLE Service
  BLEService *pService = pServer->createService(SERVICE_UUID);

  // Create BLE Characteristic
  pCharacteristic = pService->createCharacteristic(
                      CHARACTERISTIC_UUID,
                      BLECharacteristic::PROPERTY_READ |
                      BLECharacteristic::PROPERTY_WRITE
                    );

  // Start the service
  pService->start();

  // Start advertising
  pServer->getAdvertising()->start();
  Serial.println("Waiting for a client connection...");
}

void loop() {
  // Add your main code here
}

class MyServerCallbacks: public BLEServerCallbacks {
    void onConnect(BLEServer* pServer) {
      deviceConnected = true;
    };

    void onDisconnect(BLEServer* pServer) {
      deviceConnected = false;
    }
};
```

By understanding Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE, you can enable your IoT devices to communicate wirelessly, providing flexibility and connectivity in various IoT applications. This knowledge is fundamental for creating networked IoT solutions that can operate efficiently and securely.
